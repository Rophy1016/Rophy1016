- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rophy1016
- 👀 I’m interested in video game, science fiction and anti-utopia novels, like '1984'.
- 🌱 I’m currently a network engineering(JNCIE-02394) and  learning Python, because I'd like to use automation skills to reduce my workload.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any person who is good at programming.
- 📫Considering I am a beginner of programming, I am pleased to accept any help on programming.
